This code uses Python's BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries to scrape information about a product from Amazon's website. 
The get_product_info function takes a product name as input and returns a list of dictionaries, each containing information about a product including their title, price, rating, and link. 
The main function prompts the user to enter a product name and then calls the get_product_info function to retrieve the product information. 
Finally, the information is printed out to the console.
